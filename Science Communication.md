**Lab measurement**

And this is how the neurolab looks in the 
@iaostuttgart
 here we measure today, unfortunately my own lab is not ready yet.

Screen+keyboard is clear, the box in front of the monitor is the eyetracker, quasi a very fast+accurate infrared camera (up to 2000hz).

Everything still glows red, i.e. the connection of the electrodes to the scalp is not yet good.

It is also clear that no electrode gel has been applied yet.

**Vision**

I'm proud of you guys,

We actually see color in the periphery (test below)! Unfortunately, the rumor still persists that we cannot see color there, because there are significantly more rods (rods, dark vision, B/W) than cones (cones, color vision).

**EEG**

In almost 98% of all experiments the subject has to "fixate" on a point, i.e. try to make no, or as small as possible eye movements.

**Eye Rotation**

Now it's about rotating eyes!

So we move our eye about 200.000/day, 3-4 per second - do you also know in which directions?
