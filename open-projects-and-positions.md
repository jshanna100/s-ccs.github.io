# Open Positions
If you think about working with us and want to apply, I highly recommend reading through [this link](http://www.thememolab.org/pages/gradapps/) prior to writing your statement. It is from the MemoLab (US-based), but many things apply as well. At some point I hope to write my own document, but this has to suffice for now.

### PostDoc/PhD
Currently no open position.

### HiWi
Currently no open positions, potentially at the beginning of 2023.

# Open Projects
If you are interested in the areas of methods development, EEG, Eye-Tracking, Visual Processing, Cognitive Science, it is always a good idea to shoot us an email. Sometimes we have capacities for theses without a formal offer. Note on external theses: We usually only accept these if they fit within the topic of our lab.

### BSc
There are currently no specific projects.
### MSc
There are currently no specific projects.
