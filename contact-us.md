### Short Q&A

1. Greetings are hard, how should I write it?

  I lived in Norway where this problem is non-existant, but here just go for: `Dear Benedikt Ehinger` or `Dear Prof. Ehinger` - if you end your e-mail with `Firstname`, I will switch to `Firstname`, if not, I will stay with `Firstname Lastname`
 
2. When can I write a reminder?

After 7 days, for urgent matters sooner - but if it is really urgent, please find a second channel to contact me.
