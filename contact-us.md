# Get in touch

You can contact us here: [eugenia.komnik@vis.uni-stuttgart.de](mailto:eugenia.komnik@vis.uni-stuttgart.de] or [benedikt.ehinger@vis.uni-stuttgart.de](mailto:benedikt.ehinger@vis.uni-stuttgart.de).

We will try to answer within 3 business  days. 


**For students:** I lived in Norway where you'd just greet everyone by first name. This is not the case in Germany, therefore this pragmatic solution: in your first email write `Dear Benedikt Ehinger` or `Dear Prof. Ehinger` and if you end your e-mail with `Firstname`, I will answer with your `Firstname` in return. If not, I will stay with `Firstname Lastname`.
 
Sometimes it can happen that your email receives lower priority than it should - if after 7 days, for urgent matters sooner, you haven't received an answer back, please resend the email. If it is really urgent, please find a second channel to contact us.
