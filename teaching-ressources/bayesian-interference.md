# Bayesian Inference
## 2016
Together with Peter König. In this course we watched the mini-lectures of Jarad Niemi 
([can be found](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFHD4aOUZFp0Xhzd5j1nWnExD54xJfnJX) on youtube) and
discussed the content. This allows students to rewatch the videos, introduce topics themselves and give them multiple 
different angles of the same topic. On the negative side, the videos are not always motivating the content very well.
Every week we had homeworks in R, which we discussed intensively in the course. Some of the exercises are taken from 
“Doing Bayesian Data Analysis” and “Statistical Rethinking” which are both books that I highly recommend. Most are made 
by myself. Feel free to use them under CC-BY.
