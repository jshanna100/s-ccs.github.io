# KATJA HÄUSSER: PSYCHOPHYSICAL STUDY ON THE TEMPORAL AND NASAL VISUAL HEMIFIELDS AND THE BLIND SPOT \date{19. April 2016}
One of my Bachelor students (Katja Häusser) finished her thesis on parts of this study (manuscript forthcoming). This is the first piece of art I made based on a thesis. For this one, I reconstructed the main stimulus used in the psychophysics study by the complete text of the thesis.


The idea is to inspire discussion with people who do not necessarily have an academic background. The thesis might be hidden in the drawer, or is incromprehensible for people outside of science, but the poster is out there at the wall for everyone to see.
I hope to start a series, where most projects end up in an unique piece of art.
