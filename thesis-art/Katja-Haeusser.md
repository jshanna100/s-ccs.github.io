# KATJA HÄUSSER: PSYCHOPHYSICAL STUDY ON THE TEMPORAL AND NASAL VISUAL HEMIFIELDS AND THE BLIND SPOT \date{19. April 2016}
One of my Bachelor students (Katja Häusser) finished her thesis on parts of this study (manuscript forthcoming). This is the first piece of art I made based on a thesis. For this one, I reconstructed the main stimulus used in the psychophysics study by the complete text of the thesis.
