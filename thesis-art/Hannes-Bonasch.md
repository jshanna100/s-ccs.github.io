# THESIS ART: Hannes Bonasch \date{30. August 2021} \thesislink{https://cloud.wirdreibei.de/s/4fGbcAQgeKoQaYE}

Hannes Bonasch was a Master Student in our lab supervised only by Benedikt Ehinger.

Hannes investigated inter-task relations between ERP tasks leveraging the erp-core dataset. He showed that there is little correlation between decoding performance between tasks. He also had a in-depth look at explainable-AI methods.

His work was published at [CCN 2023](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.21.541632 ).

In his thesis-art one can see the activation patterns for the different effects as projected on a 2D-scalp.
