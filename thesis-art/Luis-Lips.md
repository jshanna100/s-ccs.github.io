# THESIS ART: Luis Lips \date{30. Dezember 2022} \thesislink{https://cloud.wirdreibei.de/s/RJCs8esZFtc3r5m}

Judith Schepers was the main supervisor for Luis Lips's Masters Thesis.

Luis compared two-stage with mixed model statistics for EEG data. In order to facilitate such comparisons, he laid the foundation stone for UnfoldSim.jl.

At his thesis-art one can see the difference in power between 2-stage and mixed model statistics as a contour plot.
