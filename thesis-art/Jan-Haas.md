# THESIS ART: Jan Haas \date{30. November 2021} \thesislink{https://cloud.wirdreibei.de/s/ozDpzSmxARiNWgZ}

Rene Skukies was the supervisor for Jan Haas's Bachelor Thesis.

Jan compared the traditional epoch-based technique to a more recent regression-based method for deconvolving overlapping ERPs. During EEG recordings participants played a classic 2D video game, making the recordings naturalistic and highly complex. Further, he enhanced the EEG recordings with log data generated during the game to add additional information which may be used as covariates in the regression model during analysis.
