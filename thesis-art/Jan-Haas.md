# THESIS ART: JAN HAAS \date{30. November 2021} \thesislink{link-to-thesis}

Rene Skukies was the supervisor for Jan Haas's Bachelor Thesis.

He compared the traditional epoch-based technique to a more recent regression-based method for deconvolving entangled ERPs. I enhance the EEG recordings with log data generated by the game itself to add new stim channels that may be used as covariates before using the unfold toolkit to fit ERPs to the recordings.
