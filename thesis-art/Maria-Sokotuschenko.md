# THESIS ART: MARIA SOKOTUSCHHENKO \date{18. June 2018}
I was a supervisor for Maria Sokotushchenko’s Master’s Thesis.


In her thesis-art, I artistically visualized the brain’s surprise response to a unexpected stimulus change. This response is sorted by how fast subjects responded (late on top, fast in the bottom)

The idea of “thesis art” is to inspire discussion with persons who do not have an academic background or work in a different field. The thesis is hidden in the drawer, but the poster is out there at the wall for everyone to see. You can find all past thesis art pieces here
