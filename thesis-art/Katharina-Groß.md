# Thesis Art: Katharina Groß \date{15. February 2019}
I was a supervisor for Katharina Groß’s Bachelor’s Thesis. You can find the resulting paper (!) here on biorXiv


In her project we developed a new test battery to benchmark eye-trackers in many different tasks. We concurrently measured Pupil Labs Glasses and an Eyelink 1000. In the thesis art I selected six of the tasks and visualized the data of one subject using the letters of her thesis. The tasks I used are: Fixation Grid, Smooth Pursuit, Microsaccades, Blinks, Pupil Dilation and Free Viewing.

The idea of “thesis art” is to inspire discussion with persons who do not have an academic background or work in a different field. The thesis is hidden in the drawer, but the poster is out there at the wall for everyone to see. You can find all past thesis art pieces here
