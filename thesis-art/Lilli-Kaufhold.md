# LILLI KAUFHOLD: THE INFLUENCE OF FIXATION DURATIONS ON THE INITIATION OF SACCADES \date{9. May 2016}
One of my Master students (Lilli Kaufhold) finished her thesis on parts of this study (manuscript forthcoming). I took the opportunity to form her work into a pice of art.

It is a meta-study of an eye-tracking study. I recorded my eye-movements while reading her thesis about eye movements(using these cool 3D-printable open source eye trackers!) . Every red dot is a fixation (a moment where the eye stayed still) and every line connects two fixations with an eye movement. It is clear that I focused on the words, but some figures elicit specific eye tracking behaviour. Of course it is up to the viewer to figure out, which page contains what content.


The idea is to inspire discussion with persons who do not have an academic background or work in a different field. The thesis is hidden in the drawer, but the poster is out there at the wall for everyone to see.
This is the second piece, for the first one see here.
