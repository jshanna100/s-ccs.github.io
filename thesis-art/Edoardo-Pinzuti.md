# THESIS ART: EDOARDO PINZUTI \date{30.May 2018}

I was a co-supervisor for Edoardo Pinzuti’s Master’s Thesis. I finally came around to make this artwork with the text from his thesis.


He wrote an impressive matlab toolbox to analyze causality directions in time series based on Takens Theorem. The whole idea is about reconstructing embeddings of chaotic systems, with the Lorenz system (the one depicted in this artwork) being a simulation example in his thesis. Please find the DDIFTOOL toolbox here
