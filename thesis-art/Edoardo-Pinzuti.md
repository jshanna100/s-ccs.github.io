# THESIS ART: EDOARDO PINZUTI \date{30.May 2018}

I was a co-supervisor for Edoardo Pinzuti’s Master’s Thesis. I finally came around to make this artwork with the text from his thesis.


He wrote an impressive matlab toolbox to analyze causality directions in time series based on Takens Theorem. The whole idea is about reconstructing embeddings of chaotic systems, with the Lorenz system (the one depicted in this artwork) being a simulation example in his thesis. Please find the DDIFTOOL toolbox here

The idea of “thesis art” is to inspire discussion with persons who do not have an academic background or work in a different field. The thesis is hidden in the drawer, but the poster is out there at the wall for everyone to see. You can find all past thesis art pieces here
