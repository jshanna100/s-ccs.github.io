# THESIS ART: JUDITH SCHEPERS \date{17. May 2018} \thesis{"/assets/thesis-art/a2_judith.jpg"}
I was a supervisor for Judith Scheper’s Bachelor’s Thesis.


In this thesis-art, I visualized the guided-bubble paradigm used in a recent publication in the Journal of Vision. Judith generalized the paradigm to more than five bubbles, therefore, many more bubbles are visible in the thesis-art.
