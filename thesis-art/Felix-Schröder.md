# THESIS ART: FELIX SCHRÖDER \date{30.May 2018} \thesislink{link-to-thesis}

Felix Schröder was the first Master’s Thesis in the S-CCS Lab in Stuttgart. He was co-supervised with Sebastiaan Mathôt (Groningen). 

Felix investigated the influence of auto-correlation on EEG deconvolution analyses. He found out, that indeed, autocorrelation has a big effect. Typical corrections for AR(1) are not enough, as EEG data has a much more complex relationship. Paradoxically, in some constellation, auto-correlation also decreased type-1 errors.
