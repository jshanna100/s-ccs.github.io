# Lab philosophy 

The philosophy of a lab defines its **values**, and to some degree, its **rules**. The set of following points is an ongoing discussion - as a lab evolves, its culture evolves and adapts to the needs and cultures of the members defining it.

## Core Values
1. Be **kind**.
1. Think for yourself; **question** authority.
1. Be **honest**.
1. Seek **truth**.


## Lab culture
- We want to **collaborate**, not compete - within and between labs.
- We highly value the principles of **open** science. It is better to be truthful, than be published.
- Participation in the lab- (non-social) events is expected to the best of our abilities. Asking **questions** and providing **comments** is strongly encouraged.
- Be **connected** with each other. We ask (and/or know) what others are doing and how they are feeling today.
- We make lots of space for open, constructive, direct, but always empathic **feedback**. This goes both directions, please give Bene feedback too!

## Work-Life Balance
- Our work should typically be **fun**, **fulfilling**, **interesting** and (in some sense) **important** (if it is not: contact Bene). But work is not life, and sometimes work can overburden us. Take vacation, start relationships, explore new things, grow as a person.
- Nobody checks work hours, but we expect **honest communication** on needs and limits.
- We **don't** expect **responses/work** during evenings, weekends or vacations. Exceptions (e.g. conference deadlines) should be communicated in advance.
- We schedule meetings during **core working hours** (10-16) and accommodate individual requests(e.g. care duties).

## Mental Health
- Sometimes we feel **guilty** - we forgot to do something, were slower than expected, we are overworked, we don't meet expectations, or we missed a deadline (Bene feels guilty too, unfortunately all of these things happen to him still...). We will try to fight this and **fight** it **early**. The sooner we realize what is going on (not always easy), the better we can put measures in place to stop it. **Guilt** can be a **vicious cycle**.
- **Conflicts can happen** sometimes. We try to **communicate openly**, but sometimes it might not be possible. Find a person you **trust** at the University (any kind of mentor, second supervisor, "senior" colleague, Ombudsperson, Gleichstellungsperson - best to ask around a bit, use your intuition). Seek a specific meeting with me, you can always **bring third persons** to feel more empowered. Write memory logs!
- We are open about mistakes, no progress, or other struggles. In some sense they are our day-to-day business. You can **always discuss** with Bene in the weekly meetings.

## Climate impact
Human-made climate change is the greatest challenge we face as humanity.
- Minimize climate impact of conferences, by travelling by train for everything reachable in <10h (exceptions e.g. for travelling with small children as appropriate).
- Think twice, run once - spend time on efficiency.
- We are encouraging Green computing solutions and encourage re-use in the lab where possible.

## Joining the lab?
If you are thinking to apply to the lab, here are some recommendations:
- Your motivation letter should make clear why you are applying. What is it, that you find interesting in our research/topics?
- If you worry about a gap in your CV, a bad result, or something - adress it briefly in the motivation letter rather than hoping nobody notices it.
- Lab-culture on a webpage is useless if it is not actually lived. Please contact as many PhDs/PostDocs as you want to answer all your question. Really make use of this to get a feeling of how the lab is going and how Bene is supervising. In case we have on-site visits, we will also organize such meetings.

- @ current PhD Students & PostDocs: Please take the time and give honest answers to the incoming candidates. If you recommend someone not to join the lab, I would be happy to hear that feedback as well.

## Acknowledgments
This philosophy is heavily **inspired** by [**Wei Ji Ma's**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f6foaCkHiCkPKjO0gdKkkdm2dn1EKn5xRKZv-Ut5Dg4/) Lab philosophy. Many of the points raised there resonated strongly with us.
