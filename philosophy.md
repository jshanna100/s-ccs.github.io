# Lab philosophy 

The philosophy of a lab defines its **values**, and to some degree, its **rules**. The set of following points is an ongoing discussion - as a lab evolves, its culture evolves and adapts to the needs and cultures of the members defining it.

## Core Values
1. Be **kind**.
1. Think for yourself; **question** authority.
1. Be **honest**.
1. Seek **truth**.


## Lab culture
- We want to **collaborate**, not compete - within and between labs.
- We highly value the principles of **open** science. It is better to be true, than be published.
- Participation in lab's (non-social) events is expected to the best of our abilities. Asking questions and commenting is strongly encouraged.
- Be **connected** with eachother, we ask (and/or know) what others are doing and how they are feeling today
- We make lot's of space for open, constructive, direct but always empathic **feedback**. This goes all directions, please give Bene feedback too!

## Work-Life Balance
- Our work should typically be **fun**, **fullfilling**, **interesting** and (in some sense) **important** (if it is not - contact Bene). But work is not life, and sometimes work can overburden us. Take vacation, start relationships, explore new things, grow as a person.
- Nobody checks work hours, but we expect **honest communication** on needs and limits.
- We **dont** expect **responses/work** during evenings, weekends or vacations. Exceptions (e.g. conference deadlines) should be communicated in advance.
- We schedule meetings during **core working hours** (10-16) and accomodate individual requests( e.g. care duties)

## Mental Health
- Sometimes we feel **guilty** - we forgot to do something, were slower than expected, we are overworked, we don't meet expectations, or we missed a deadline (Bene feels guilty too, unfortunately all of these things happen to him still...). We will try to fight this and **fight** it **early**. The sooner we realize what is going on (not always easy), the better we can put measures in place to stop it. **Guilt** can be a **vicious cycle**.
- **Conflicts happen** sometimes. We try to **communicate open**, but sometimes it might not be possible. Find a person you **trust** from University (any kind of mentor, second supervisor, "senior" colleague, Ombudsperson, Gleichstellungsperson - best to ask around a bit, use your intuition). Seek a specific meeting with me, you can always **bring third persons** to feel more empowered. Write Ged√§chtnisprotokolle
- We are open about mistakes, no progress, or other struggles. In some sense they are our daily bread. You can **always discuss** with Bene in the weekly meetings.

## Climate impact
Human climate change is the greates challenge we face as humanity.
- Minimize climate impact of conferences, by travling by train for everything reachable in <10h (exceptions e.g. for travelling with small children as appropriate)
- Think twice, run once - spend time on efficiency.
- We are encouraging Green computing solutions and encourage re-use in the lab where possible

## Joining the lab?
If you are thinking to apply for the lab, here are some recommendations:
- Your motivation letter should make clear why you are applying. What is it, that you find interesting in our research / topics? Where do you want to learn and grow?
- If you worry about a gap in your CV, a bad result, or something - I would adress it briefly in the motivation letter rather than hoping nobody notices it.
- Lab-culture on a webpage is useless if it is not actually lived. Please contact as many PhDs/PostDocs as you want to answer all your question. Really make use of this to get a feeling of how the lab is going and how Bene is supervising. In case we have on-site visits, we will also organize this.

- @ current PhD Students & PostDocs: Please take the time and answer honestly to the incoming candidates. If you recommend someone not to join the lab, I'd be happy to hear that feedback as well.

This philosophy is heavily **inspired** by [**Wei Ji Ma's**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f6foaCkHiCkPKjO0gdKkkdm2dn1EKn5xRKZv-Ut5Dg4/) Lab philosophy document. Many of these points ressonanted with us.
