# LAB Philosophy 
1. Think for yourself.
   
2. Be bold, question the authority.
   
3. Be kind.
   
4. Be honest.


## Lab culture
- We want to collaborate, not compete - within and between labs.
- We highly value the principles of open science. It is better to be true, than be published.
- Participation in lab's events is expected to the best of our abilities. Asking questions and commenting is strongly encouraged.
- Be connected with eachother, we ask (and/or know) what others are doing and how they are feeling today
- We make lot's of space for open, constructive, direct but always empathic feedback. This goes all directions, please give Bene feedback too!

## Work-Life Balance
- Our work should typically be fun, fullfilling, intersting and (in some sense) important (if it is not - contact Bene). But work is not life, and sometimes work can overburden us. Take vacation, start relationships, explore new things, grow as a person.
- Nobody checks work hours, but we expect honest communication on needs and limits.
- We dont expect responses/work during evenings, weekends or vacations. Exceptions (e.g. conference deadlines) should be communicated in advance.
- We schedule meetings during core working hours (10-16) and accomodate individual requests( e.g. care duties)

## Feelings
- Sometimes we feel guilty - we forgot to do something, were slower than expected, we are overworked, we don't meet expectations, or we missed a deadline (Bene feels guilty too, unfortunately all of these things happen to him still...). We will try to fight this and fight it early. The sooner we realize what is going on (not always easy), the better we can put measures in place to stop it. Guilt can be a vicious cycle.
- Conflicts happen sometimes. We try to communicate open, but sometimes it might not be possible. Find a person you trust from University (any kind of mentor, second supervisor, "senior" colleague, Ombudsperson, Gleichstellungsperson - best to ask around a bit, use your intuition). Seek a meeting with me, you can always bring third persons to feel more empowered. Write Ged√§chtnisprotokolle
- We are open about mistakes, no progress, or other "failures". In some sense they are our daily bread. You can always discuss with Bene in the weekly meetings.

## Acknowledgments
This philosophy is heavily inspired by [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f6foaCkHiCkPKjO0gdKkkdm2dn1EKn5xRKZv-Ut5Dg4/](Wei Ji Ma's) Lab philosophy document. Many of these points ressonanted with me.
