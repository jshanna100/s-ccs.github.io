*"I just saw a twitter discussion on implicit expectations to respond to emails/messages send at strange times. I just want to stress, that I sometimes answer/send around stuff at unusual times outside the typical 9-17. Reason is simple: I want to work less while Ida (my kid) is awake, and use the time when she sleeps. So please don't feel any urge to respond directly, just respond when it is ok for you. If something is truely urgent, I will send another email / choose other channels to contact you"*
